# Torrential Twitter: Climate Change, Female Politicians, and Harassment 

## Abstract
Women in politics face considerable harassment. Known as “gendertrolling,” this harassment is part of a global trend of violence against women in politics. There are many significant previously documented cases of gendertrolling on public social media platforms such as Twitter. Framed through the theory of deliberative democracy, this study conducts quantitative content analysis on the replies received by three female politicians in Canada when Tweeting about climate change and the environment. These politicians are Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland (from the Liberal Party), Elizabeth May (co-Leader of the Green Party), and Laurel Collins (from the New Democratic Party). I then built a Bayesian hierarchical model to investigate the relationship between the severity of harassment and the type of account that a user has. The majority of replies contain some form of harassment, often questioning authority or name-calling/gender insults, and come from users that have spam or anonymous accounts. *This paper contains language and themes that some readers may find offensive.*

## File Structure

The repo is structured as the following:

-   `Inputs` contains the PDF of the Codebook to code the Tweets.

-   `Outputs` contains a sample dataset and the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document, bibliography file, model, and the PDF of the paper. The presentation slides and files used to generate them are also in this folder.

-   `Scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean, validate, and model the data.

### Note on Data
The raw and cleaned datasets cannot be uploaded to GitHub. A sample dataset of the coded Tweets without any identifying information can be found in the `Outputs\Data` folder. Please contact Inessa (<Inessa.DeAngelis@mail.utoronto.ca>) to access the full datasets.

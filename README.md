# Torrential Twitter: Climate Change, Female Politicians, and Harassment 

## Project Overview
This paper analyses Tweets which specifically discuss climate change from DPM Chrystia Freeland, MP Elizabeth May, and MP Laurel Collins to investigate the severity of harassment on a seven-point scale and type of accounts behind the Tweets. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as the following:

-   `Inputs` contains the PDF of the Codebook to code the Tweets.

-   `Outputs` contains a sample dataset and the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document, bibliography file, model, and the PDF of the paper. The presentation slides and files used to generate them are also in this folder.

-   `Scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean, validate, and model the data.

### Note on Data
The raw and cleaned datasets cannot be uploaded to GitHub. A sample dataset of the coded Tweets without any identifying information can be found in the `Outputs\Data` folder. Please contact Inessa (inessa.deangelis@mail.utoronto.ca) to access the full datasets.
